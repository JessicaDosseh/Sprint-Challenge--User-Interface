            <header>If you were to describe semantic HTML to the next cohort of students, what would you say?</header>
            <p> Semantic HTML: is the process of providing meaning to your content, making your website readable and easily interpreted by developers, and machines. Instead of only using [div] tags consider using semantic HTML tags such as: [h1 through h6] — [header] — [section] — [p] — [nav] — [header] — [address] — [footer] — Etc… Note that [div]'s are not bad. They are commonly used when 'describing meaning' isn't your primary goal — also used for creating space, structure, or style elements. </p>

            <header>Name two big differences between display: block; and display: inline;.</header>
            <p>
                
              display: block; — Displays items as a block (full with of page) just like how paragraphs and headers have always been. A block has some whitespace above and below it. Elements are not able to stack next to each other unless we use code it to do so.
              <div></div>
              display: inline; — Displays items that are stacked next to each other inside one particular block. When the inline is between two blocks, it has the smallest possible width.

            <p>Git is valuable to a team of developers because it tracks the changes we've made to our code files and creates versions / branches that allow us to make changes and move forward without breaking our codebase.  </p>
